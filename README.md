# Introduction

Data analytics in finance involves using data and statistical techniques to analyze financial data to identify patterns, trends, and relationships that can inform financial decision making. 

## Objectives
1. Identifying trends and patterns in financial data: By analyzing financial data, such as revenue, expenses, and cash flow, data analytics can identify trends and patterns that can help to inform financial decision making. For example, data analytics can help to identify which products or services are most profitable, which expenses are most significant, and which customers are most valuable.
2. Predicting future financial performance: By analyzing historical financial data, data analytics can be used to predict future financial performance. This can help to inform decisions about budgeting, forecasting, and investment.
3. Improving risk management: By analyzing financial data, data analytics can help to identify potential risks and opportunities. This can help to inform decisions about risk management, such as which investments to make and which risks to avoid.
4. Enhancing fraud detection: By analyzing financial data, data analytics can help to identify potential instances of fraud. This can help to prevent financial losses and protect the integrity of financial data.

### Fundamental aspects of data analytics in finance include:

1. Data Collection: Gathering financial data from various sources such as market data, transaction data, and news data.

2. Data Cleaning: Removing errors, inconsistencies, and irrelevant information from the data to improve the quality of analysis.

3. Data Visualization: Representing financial data graphically to make it easier to understand and identify trends and patterns.

4. Descriptive Analytics: Summarizing the financial data to describe what happened and why.

5. Predictive Analytics: Using statistical and machine learning models to forecast future events based on historical data.

6. Prescriptive Analytics: Using advanced optimization and simulation models to suggest actions that can optimize financial outcomes.

7. Data Management: Storing and organizing financial data to make it accessible for analysis and reporting.

These fundamental aspects form the foundation of data analytics in finance and can be applied to various financial domains such as risk management, investment management, and fraud detection.

# Asking the right question
### PT XYZ has Account Receivable data for the closing period February 28, 2022. From the data, the questions that can be asked are:
1. How much is there (in rupiah) payment of receivables from last period (January) to this period (February)
2. How many amounts (in rupiah) of receivables payments have deteriorated in this period
3. How many are there (in percent) receivables that returned current in this period this period?
4. How much (in rupiah) is the amount of receivables that have difficulty paying (Non-performing Financing)

## Data Cleansing Process
1. Ensure there are no there are no blank values in the data set
2. Sort the number sequence that was originally out of sequence
3. Uniformize the data type of each column (example: Number, Date, Currency)

## Current to Current

Based on summary data, PT XYZ has IDR 355,022,459,564 (84.47%) of current receivables for the period of February 28, 2022. This amount is still relatively good because most customers are still able to pay before the due date.

Back to Current is the condition of payment of receivables that were not smooth, then returned to smooth (paid before maturity). Based on the existing summary data, there are 10% of receivables that are paid back before maturity at PT XYZ for the closing period February 28, 2022. The 10% percentage needs to be further investigated for the cause, because the receivables that return to current are still relatively low.

How many are there (in percent) receivables that returned current in this period this period ?
